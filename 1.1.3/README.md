# INTRO-CS-3 Algorithms-Introduction

## Logical
On pen and paper, solve the logical exercises and give the expected output statement (true / false)
```
( true && true ) 
( false && true ) 
( true && false ) 
( false && false )
( true || true)     
( true || false )   
( false || true)   
( false || false )  
!( false || true )   
!( false && true )
( !false && true )
( !true && true )
( !false || false )
```

## Additional Exercises
### Part 1

1. Open a repl.it Javascript page and call it Algorithms Introduction Exercise 1.
2. Write a program where a user enters the number of tasks they have completed. The program returns one of the following labels to the console:
```
**Failed**
**Insufficient**
**Good**
**Excellent**
**Error**
```

based on the conditions:
* **Failed** if they scored 6 or less
* **Insufficient** if they scored > 6 but less than 9. (6 included)
* **Good** if they scored > 9 but less than 14. (9 included)
* **Excellent** if they scored 15.
* **Error** if participants enter a negative number or a number outside the range supported (outside 0 - 15)

### Part 2

1. Open a repl.it Javascript page and call it Algorithms Introduction Exercise 2.
2. Write an algorithm to find the largest among three different numbers entered by the user.
3. Print out the largest number to the console.

### Part 3
1. Open a repl.it Javascript page and call it Algorithms Introduction Exercise 3.
2. We have 3 items and we know the price for each. However, we can only buy the two least expensive items.
3. Write an algorithm that takes in three user inputs and outputs the two smallest prices to the console.
