## Arrays

1. Open up a blank repl.it set to Javascript. Copy the code below into your workspace:

```
var arr = ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."];
function printOutString() {
  // your code here
}

printOutString();
```
Complete the function to print out the string `This is a sentence.`

2. Write a function that:
* Takes in an array of numbers
* Doubles the value of each number in the array
* Prints out the new updated array

Example: 
Given an array `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. 
The output should be `[2, 4, 8, 10]`

3. Write a program to compute the sum and product (multiplication) of an array of numbers. Print out the sum and the product.

Example:
Given an array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
The sum is 10.
The product is 24.
