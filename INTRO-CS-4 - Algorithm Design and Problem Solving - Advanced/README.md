# INTRO-CS-4 - Algorithm Design and Problem Solving - Advanced

## Arrays

#### Exercise #1 
Open up a blank repl.it set to Javascript. Copy the code below into your workspace:

```
var arr = ["This", "is", "a", "sentence."];
function printOutString() {
  // your code here
}

printOutString();
```
Complete the function to print out the string `This is a sentence.`

#### Exercise #2
Write a function that:
* Takes in an array of numbers
* Doubles the value of each number in the array
* Prints out the new updated array

Example: 
Given an array `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. 
The output should be `[2, 4, 8, 10]`

#### Exercise #3
Write a program to compute the sum and product (multiplication) of an array of numbers. Print out the sum and the product.

Example:
Given an array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
The sum is 10.
The product is 24.

#### Exercise #4
Write a program that takes in an array of numbers and returns the largest number in the list.
Example:
The given array is  `[3, 5, 7, 1, 6]`
The largest number is 7.

#### Exercise #5
For each of the exercises below, assume you are starting with the following people array.

`var people = ["Maria", "Dani", "Luis", "Juan", "Camila"];`

1. Write a command that prints out all of the people in the list.
2. Write the command to remove "Dani" from the array.
3. Write the command to remove "Juan" from the array.
4. Write the command to add "Luis" to the front of the array.
5. Write the command to add your name to the end of the array.
6. Using a loop, iterate through this array and after console.log-ing "Maria", exit from the loop.
7. Write the command that gives the indexOf where "Maria" is located.

At the end of the exercise, there should be 4 people in the array.

## Sorting

#### Exercise #1
Write a program to sort a list of numbers in descending order (from highest to lowest).

#### Exercise #2
Write a program to sort a list of names alphabetically.
