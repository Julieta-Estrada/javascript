#1.1.2 Introduction to Algorithms (120 minutes)

Designing Algorithms and Writing Pseudocode
Remember the steps of solving an algorithm:

```
Input- There should be 0 or more inputs supplied externally to the algorithm.
Output- There should be atleast 1 output obtained.
Definiteness- Every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined.
Finiteness- The algorithm should have a finite number of steps.
Correctness- Every step of the algorithm must generate a correct output.
```

On a piece of paper write out the steps to solving each of the problems.

1. Given a list of positive numbers [3, 5, 7, 1, 6], return the largest number in the list.

2. // exercise tbd

3. 15 people are waiting in line for the store. There are 3 cashiers (Marie, Tomas, and Marco) who are available.
   Marco is new so he helps 1 person out for every 2 people that Marie helps.
   Tomas can only help 3 people maximum before he goes back to restocking the shelves.
   How many people does each cashier help?

Variables and Primitive types (30 min)

1. Go to the repl.it. (link to be added)
2. Open up the file and match up the correct primitives for each of the variables.
3. Run your responses.
4. You are done when all the tests pass as true.

Taking in user input exercises (30 min)

1. Construct a program that takes in your name and saves it to a variable.
   Print out `Hello my name is ` with your name to the console.

2. Construct a program that.
   1. Takes in a celsius temperature.
   2. Converts the temperature from celsius to fahrenheit. 
      The code for the conversion is below:
      `var fahrenheit = celsiusTemp * 9 / 5 + 32;`
   3. Outputs the fahrenheit temperature to the console.
